# Website Templates

this is a framework / template framework with different website templates for me and you to use if you want to just to make it easier to build websites when needed. I will add different websites over a couple of weeks or months that will be good to go. 


** NOTE **
Note that these are built in Nextjs so if you want to run them you'll need to
> $ yarn dev
### Or
> $ npm run dev

To get into the developer version otherwise it is in the [package.json](https://github.com/linkone1/website-templates/blob/main/package.json) file
in the `scripts` section
